Compiler in swift

Web UI available at: http://45.33.86.166/
- note the webui currently only compiles a static piece of source

The easiest way to run the compiler is through xcode. In the main class, there is a string called 'userInput'. For now, this variable holds the source that is compiler. You can replace the string with whatever you want to test. Hopfully I will get the webui working before you have to resort to this.
