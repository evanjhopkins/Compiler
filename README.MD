Compiler in swift

Web UI available at: http://45.33.86.166/
- note the webui currently only compiles a static piece of source

The easiest way to run the compiler is through xcode. Upon running the main class (hit the run button in the top right of xcode), you will be promted to paste in the source you wish to test.
