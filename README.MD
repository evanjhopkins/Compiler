Compiler in swift

##Instructions to Run
If you would like to run source from a file, you can do it:  
   ```cat your_source_file.txt | ./compiler_binary```

You may also type your source directly in the command line in the following way:  
   ```echo "{print(5)}$" | ./compiler_binary```

##Verbose
You can toggle verbose mode by add a "-v" flag when running the compiler   
   ```cat your_source_file.txt | ./compiler_binary -v```
